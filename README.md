# 🍛 Indian Cuisine Preparation Time Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the preparation and cooking times of various Indian dishes. By analyzing these time requirements, we aim to identify patterns and visualize key insights using data analysis techniques.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Understanding the time needed to prepare and cook Indian dishes is valuable for meal planning, restaurant management, and culinary studies. This project provides an in-depth analysis of time distribution across different Indian recipes.

## 🔍 Solution Approach
1. **Data Collection** – Gather a dataset containing dish names, preparation times, and cooking times.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Remove unnecessary columns, check for missing values, and structure data for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis** – Perform statistical evaluations to identify time variations.
4. **Data Visualization** – Use graphs and charts to showcase patterns in cooking and preparation times.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV Dataset Processing**

## 🔑 Key Operations Performed
- Importing and inspecting the dataset.
- Check for missing values and clean the data.
- Analyzing preparation and cooking times for various dishes.
- Visualizing time distributions using bar charts, histograms, and box plots.

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar Charts** – Compare preparation and cooking times across dishes.
- **Histograms** – Understand the frequency distribution of time values.
- **Box Plots** – Identify outliers and spread of time data.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the code cells to analyze and visualize the dataset.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset with more dishes and regional variations.
- Implement machine learning models to predict cooking times based on ingredients.
- Develop a web dashboard for interactive analysis.
